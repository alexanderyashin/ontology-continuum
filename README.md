The Ontology of Continua
Unified Axiomatic Framework for Emergence, Persistence and Collapse

Author: Alexander Yashin
Version: v1.0-preprint

Overview

The Ontology of Continua (OC) is a unified axiomatic framework describing
the emergence, persistence and collapse of structured systems across
physics, chemistry, biology, cognition, social systems and
civilisational dynamics.

Structured entities (“continua”) are defined by:

axes of distinction A

potentials P

thresholds Θ

fluxes J

cycles C

admissible domain Ω(K)

boundary ∂Ω(K)

structural tension T

continuity/existence measure k

lifetime τ

A universal dynamical operator governs all change:
dX_K/dt = (F, G, H, Q, R, S, U)(X_K, M)

A twelve-level hierarchy (K₀–K₁₂) spans from proto-continua and
percolation to chemistry, protocells, bioelectric systems, cognition,
institutions, civilisations, and higher-order metatheories.
