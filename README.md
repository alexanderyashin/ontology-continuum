This repository contains the full LaTeX source of The Ontology of Continua, a unified axiomatic theory describing how structured systems emerge, stabilize, gain new dimensions, and collapse across all major scientific domains.
The framework defines continua via axes of distinction, potentials, thresholds, fluxes, cycles, admissible domains, boundary geometry, structural tension, and a universal dynamical operator acting within a metaspace hierarchy.
The theory includes a 12-level ontology (K₀–K₁₂), covering physics → chemistry → biology → cognition → social systems → civilisations → metatheories, with strict continuity theorems and falsifiable predictions.
