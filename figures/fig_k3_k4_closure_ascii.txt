  \caption{Transition from autocatalytic chemistry ($K_3$) to protocellular
  closure ($K_4$). 
  The diagram shows an autocatalytic RAF-network embedded in an open reaction
  medium and the appearance of a semi-permeable membrane that defines an
  inside/outside axis. 
  Once the membrane is present and osmotic as well as mechanical thresholds
  are respected, a new admissible region $\Omega(K_4)$ appears, containing
  states in which the RAF-network is confined, maintained and energetically
  supported inside a bounded volume. 
  This closure marks a dimensional transition: the membrane creates an
  additional axis (inside/outside) and turns purely chemical dynamics into a
  protocellular continuum with its own $k_4(t)$.}
