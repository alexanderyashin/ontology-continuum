  \caption{Admissible region $\Omega(K)$ and its boundary $\partial\Omega(K)$. 
  The interior region represents all states $s$ for which potentials, axes,
  thresholds, flows and cycles satisfy the admissibility conditions of
  Definition~\ref{subsec:foundations-omega}. 
  The curve labelled $\partial\Omega(K)$ marks the locus where at least one
  threshold is saturated, $T(s)=0$ or a potential/axis touches the edge of its
  domain. 
  Points outside the curve correspond to structurally forbidden states with
  $T(s)>0$, where the continuum cannot exist. 
  The figure provides the geometric intuition for structural tension and
  phase transitions used throughout the hierarchy.}
