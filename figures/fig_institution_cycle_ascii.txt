  \caption{Institutional cycle in the social continuum $K_7$. 
  The diagram depicts a closed loop of stages such as norm formation,
  codification, implementation, enforcement, feedback and revision. 
  As long as this cycle $C_{\mathrm{inst}}$ remains closed and traversable,
  the institution maintains a non-zero contribution to $k_7$: 
  social expectations can be stabilised and coordinated action is possible. 
  If any link in the cycle is broken (for example enforcement fails or
  feedback is systematically ignored), the path leaves $\Omega(K_7)$ and the
  institution collapses or transforms into a different structure. 
  This visualises how social order is treated as a dynamical cycle rather
  than a static object.}
