  \caption{Civilisational tension and stability in $K_8$. 
  The figure plots a measure of civilisational structural tension $T_8$ 
  (combining load on infrastructures, institutional stress and resource
  pressure) against time or against an external driving parameter. 
  A stability threshold $\Theta_{\mathrm{stab}}$ marks the boundary between
  configurations that can be re-stabilised by existing cycles
  $C_{\mathrm{stab}}$ and configurations in which the civilisational
  continuum leaves its admissible region $\Omega(K_8)$ and undergoes partial
  collapse or reorganisation. 
  The curve typically exhibits hysteresis: once key structures are lost, 
  returning the driving parameter to its former value does not automatically
  restore the original $k_8$. 
  This provides a compact visual summary of the model's predictions about
  systemic fragility and path dependence at the civilisational level.}
